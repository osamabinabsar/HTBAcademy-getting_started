#### Asking Questions Effectively

If we are stuck at a certain point on a box or a challenge, we may want to ask a question in one of the above channels.
To get the best guidance on our problem, we need to ask our questions effectively.

Be sure to include the following in our question:

      What point of the box/challenge are we stuck at 'i.e., user/root'?
      What steps have we taken so far to get to the point we are at?
      What step are we failing at, and what have we done to resolve our issue?
      Always try to be very specific on what we need help on, rather than asking for general help

When we form our question using the above points, we may get some ideas that we may have missed, which can help us answer the question ourselves. Sometimes a comment from someone else will get us to an "aha!" moment, and we will be able to answer your question essentially. Other times we will find someone willing to work with us to solve our issue. It is always best to approach things from a learning perspective and not just look for answers to get points or improve our hall of fame positioning. We should NOT do any of the following:

    Give away spoilers or clear indications that may spoil the machine for other people
    Be vague in our description without providing enough details of what we have done

Answering Questions Effectively

If we have completed a specific box or challenge, we may want to help others by answering their questions. Getting involved in the community helps us build connections and build our team, which is a great way to improve our overall penetration testing and information security level. It may also help us build our Hack The Box profile and strengthen your understanding of the box or challenge you have just completed. When answering questions, be sure to do the following:

    Be as spoiler-free as possible, and do not get direct instructions on how to complete the current step or the entire box
    Give minor hints or tips that can lead to the right direction for completion, and do not give entire suggestions for completion
    Share resources that we found helpful
    Share tips on points we were getting stuck on

-----------------------------------------------
##### Boxes & Challenges

Having completed one easy box as part of this module, we should be ready to start laying out more ambitious goals.
##### Root a Retired Easy Box

Choose a retired box rated Easy and root the box by following the provided writeup included with the VIP membership needed to access retired boxes.

Tip: Try to watch a video walkthrough of the box, and then try to replicate what you learned without following the video step-by-step. In case you get stuck, you can refer to the walkthrough again.
Complete a Retired Medium Box

Once we root one or several Easy boxes, try to up the level by completing a Medium box, which will probably require additional knowledge that is usually not required for Easy boxes.
##### Root Our First Live Box

Once we have completed 5-10 Easy/Medium retired boxes, you should be able to complete your first Easy box without following a full walkthrough. Try to pick an Easy Box with difficulty ratings at level 1-3 out of 10. If we get stuck, we can always get help from the channels previously discussed.

Our first live box may be the most difficult, as we are entirely dependant on ourselves for the first time without referring to walkthroughs or writeups. This is an excellent indication that we are learning. Once we finish our first live box, try to complete other live boxes and other Medium/Hard live boxes.
#### Keep Learning

Although doing boxes and following writeups is an excellent way of learning, we may find many difficult topic areas in boxes and challenges. This may mean that we may leave certain essential aspects in penetration testing uncompleted if we only depend on boxes and walkthroughs for learning. This is why it is essential to keep working through other Academy Modules in areas we feel we need to improve upon until we feel strong enough in each topic area.

Furthermore, individual boxes only focus on a single area of learning, so we will need to supplement our approach with guided learning, i.e., Academy Modules, to become a more well-rounded penetration tester or information security professional.

Tip: Try to build a list of modules you are interested in, and add them to your 'To-Do' list. Whenever you feel like improving yourself, go back to your 'To-Do' list and complete your next module.

10.10.14.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.254.0   U         0 0          0 tun0
10.129.0.0      10.10.14.1      255.255.0.0     UG        0 0          0 tun0
From here, we can see that we are connected to the 10.10.14.0/23 network on the tun0 adapter and have access to the 10.129.0.0/16 network
The `/23` and `/16` notations are CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notations that represent the subnet mask associated with an IP address. These notations help define the range of IP addresses within a network, specifying which part of the IP address is the network portion and which part is the host portion.

### Understanding `/23` and `/16`:

1. **IP Address Structure**:
   - An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number, usually written in the dotted-decimal format (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
   - Each octet (a group of 8 bits) in an IP address is separated by a dot. So, for `192.168.1.1`, the binary representation would be `11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001`.

2. **Subnet Mask**:
   - A subnet mask divides the IP address into two parts: the network part and the host part.
   - In CIDR notation, `/X` specifies the number of bits that are set to `1` in the subnet mask, defining the network portion.

3. **/23 Subnet Mask**:
   - `/23` means that the first 23 bits of the IP address are used for the network part, and the remaining 9 bits are for the host part.
   - Subnet Mask in Binary: `11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000`
   - Subnet Mask in Decimal: `255.255.254.0`
   - **Network Range**:
     - For example, a network with the IP `10.10.14.0/23` can have IP addresses from `10.10.14.0` to `10.10.15.255`. 
     - This gives you `2^(32-23) = 512` IP addresses in this range (including the network and broadcast addresses).

4. **/16 Subnet Mask**:
   - `/16` means that the first 16 bits of the IP address are used for the network part, and the remaining 16 bits are for the host part.
   - Subnet Mask in Binary: `11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000`
   - Subnet Mask in Decimal: `255.255.0.0`
   - **Network Range**:
     - For example, a network with the IP `10.129.0.0/16` can have IP addresses from `10.129.0.0` to `10.129.255.255`.
     - This gives you `2^(32-16) = 65,536` IP addresses in this range (including the network and broadcast addresses).

### Summary:

- `/23` provides a network with 512 possible IP addresses.
- `/16` provides a network with 65,536 possible IP addresses.

### Practical Implication:

- **10.10.14.0/23** means you're connected to a network that includes IP addresses from `10.10.14.0` to `10.10.15.255`.
- **10.129.0.0/16** means you have access to a network that includes IP addresses from `10.129.0.0` to `10.129.255.255`.

Understanding these notations helps in network configuration, especially in tasks related to routing, subnetting, and penetration testing.

Burp Suite being described as a "web application proxy" means that it acts as an intermediary between your web browser and the target web server. When you configure your browser to use Burp Suite as a proxy, all the traffic between your browser and the server goes through Burp Suite. This allows you to intercept, inspect, modify, and analyze the HTTP/S requests and responses that are exchanged between your browser and the web server.

### Key Concepts of Burp Suite as a Web Application Proxy:

1. **Intercepting Traffic**:
   - Burp Suite can capture and display all the HTTP/S traffic between your browser and the web application. This means you can see exactly what your browser is sending to the server and what the server is sending back.

2. **Inspecting and Modifying Requests and Responses**:
   - You can inspect the details of the requests and responses, including headers, parameters, cookies, and the body of the message. 
   - Burp Suite allows you to modify these details before the request is sent to the server or before the response is delivered to the browser. This is crucial for tasks like testing for vulnerabilities or understanding how the web application behaves under different conditions.

3. **Analyzing Web Application Behavior**:
   - By using Burp Suite as a proxy, you can observe the full interaction between your browser and the application, which is essential for identifying security flaws, such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), authentication issues, etc.

4. **Automation and Extensions**:
   - Burp Suite comes with various tools like Spider (for crawling web applications), Repeater (for manual testing of requests), and Intruder (for automated attacks like brute force). 
   - You can also extend Burp Suiteâ€™s functionality with plugins to enhance your testing capabilities.

### Practical Usage:

- **Security Testing**: Penetration testers and security professionals use Burp Suite to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **Web Development**: Developers might use Burp Suite to debug HTTP/S traffic, ensuring their applications handle requests and responses correctly.
- **Learning Tool**: For those learning about web security, Burp Suite serves as an excellent tool to understand how web applications work and how they can be attacked.

### Example Scenario:

Let's say you're testing a web application for security flaws. By setting your browser to use Burp Suite as a proxy:

1. You visit a login page on the web application.
2. The login request (with the username and password) goes from your browser to Burp Suite.
3. Burp Suite intercepts the request, allowing you to view or modify the login credentials before sending it to the server.
4. After modifying the request (if needed), you forward it to the server.
5. The server processes the request and sends back a response, which Burp Suite again intercepts before it reaches your browser.
6. You can then analyze the response to see if your test was successful (e.g., detecting if the server is vulnerable to SQL injection).

### Summary:

Burp Suite as a "web application proxy" means it sits between your browser and a web application, allowing you to control, inspect, and modify the communication. This is essential for security testing, debugging, and understanding the behavior of web applications.
